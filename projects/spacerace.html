                <p>My first experience in ever finishing an actual game in Unity is during the Adventure GameJam 2023, where I had 1 week to design, program, and build an adventure game. While I did not win this competition, I had learned a lot about game development, and how stressful deadlines can be</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>I had created all the sprites by myself using Adobe Illustrator, while also taking sprites from open source repositories (such as the laser sprites) and editing them slightly to fit my artstyle. I had also used the music of my friend, <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/acorn-673156534" target = "_blank">you should check them out here!</a></p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Overall, I think that I did a great job with the resources and time I had. I was only working by myself, and used premade music that my friend had made beforehand. However, I used the resources I was given and pushed myself to finish, creating a fairly fun 5 minute romp against a space monkey with jetpacks. However, if I had more time, I would have had a more cohesive ending, with the character you play as reuniting with his daughter (which was my initial storyline), and having a more satisfying explosion once the final boss had been killed. However, I am proud with how this project turned out, and kindled an interest for me to pursue game development as a possible career choice in the future.</p>
