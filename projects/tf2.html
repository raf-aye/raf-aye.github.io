                <p>I play <strong>a LOT</strong> of Team Fortress 2. Probably an unhealthy amount, but it is a very fun game. I've always heard of challenges where you would randomize weapons that you have and try to make the best of them, but I had wondered "What if you could randomize <i>Everything</i> about your loadout?"</p>
                <br>
                <p>Surprisingly, something like that had not existed yet, not even something that could use your own items to randomize the weapons that you had. So I had created the ultimate <a href = "https://tf2-randomizer.netlify.app/" target = "_blank"><u>Team Fortress 2 Randomizer</u></a>: Randomizing weapons, cosmetics, class, and even strategy, all from your own inventory.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It uses the Steam API to interact with the item servers, accessing your backpack (if you do not have it set to private) and taking your weapons and cosmetics and randomizing it based on the class it had picked. This is useful for those who want to challenge themselves with silly weapons while also looking as sily as possbile. You can even provide your Steam profile link at the top in order to link it to your profile.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, there are some issues with this website. This is one of the first websites I had ever made, so it's very clunky and doesn't work that well in resolutions not 1280x720, and does not work at all on mobile, and the Steam API is also not the best, constantly returning empty objects which I can't do much about. However, I find it fun working with APIs, and I believe that more companies should allow their users to mess with their data to create cool and interesting things that will benefit a wide audience. I've used this in my Team Fortress 2 gameplay quite a bit whenever I wanted to spice things up, and I like how similar it looks to the artstyle of Team Fortress 2, just like it came straight out of the game.</p>
